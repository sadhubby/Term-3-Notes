Intelligent Systems
	- Computation systems that perceive, evaluate and decide their actions in ways that a human would.
	- Are used to **assist** humans.

Artificial Intelligence
	- Backbone of intelligent systems
	- study of how machine can exhibit at least one aspect associated with intelligent behavior, such as:
		1. Problem Solving: performance of non-trivial goal-directed tasks
		2. Reasoning: drawing logical inferences from facts
		3. Learning: improvement of performance through experience

### **Modelling Inference Learning Paradigm**

Real-world problem - > Model
	Modelling: representing a real world task into an abstract model
Model -> Answer / Solution
	Inference: answer questions / find solutions to the problem, algorithms
Model - > Fine-tuned model
	Learning: sometimes, models can be fine-tuned based on historical data
	
Example:
- Real world problem: find a route from one place to another in manila considering the traffic.
- Modelling: use a weighted graph to model the problem
	- Nodes: places / junctions
	- Edges: roads
	- Weights: amount of traffic on that road
- Learning: Improve the weights assigned to each edge based on historical data observed in the real world

Four Types of AI:
1. Symbolic AI: top-down approach
	 Identify the "rules" of the problem and model it
	 Find a solution based on rules
2. Neural AI: bottom-up approach
	 Start with examples then feed to model
	 Adjust the "rules" of the model based on the data
3. Statistical AI: view of mathematicians
	 provides mathematical rigor to AI approaches
