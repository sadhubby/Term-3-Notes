##### To recap:
correlation can only be found in an observational study.
	we can say 2 variables are related (correlated) but we cannot say one causes another (causation) 

For causation to be established, a proper experimental setup must be conducted:
	at least two comparison groups ( one experimental, one control)
	variation in independent occurs before assessment of change in dependent


### Sampling

- Population refers to group of elements to ==generalize== data on.
	- contextual
	- body of elements for study
	- ex: if study is about whether something is true for the entire student body of DLSU, the population is student body of DLSU
- In an ideal world, data should be collected from the whole population. However, often it is not possible
- Instead a sample is collected to represent the entire population. 
	- sample - produce a subset of the population that is representative of the population itself
- If the sample is selected properly, then findings in the sample can be generalized to the entire population.

### Sampling Bias
1. Convenience Bias - only data that is easy to collect is included in the sample
2. Nonresponse Bias - some chosen participants for the sample are unwilling to give data
3. Voluntary response - people who volunteered themselves (self-selected) are included in the sample
4. Exclusion Bias - some groups of people are deliberately excluded to participate
Do statistical tests to determine whether the sample is representative of the population
To lessen biases, such as voluntary or nonresponse, they usually select participants then ask for consent. 
Voluntary participation bias:
	volunteers (not selected yet) are able to contribute to the data for study, which can be part of the extremes and not the general average

### Sampling Strategies
1. Simple Random Sampling
	- Randomly select observations from population
	- Why does it often represent the population?
2. Stratified Random Sampling
	- Group the population into meaningful strata, then randomly sample from each group
	- Stratum - grouping wherein a characteristic of the elements inside the group is homogenous - 'same' quality; outside of a stratum, group of stratums, is heterogenous - 'different' quality
3. Cluster Sampling
	- Divide the population into clusters then choose a subset of clusters to include in the sample
	- Compared to stratum:
		- Stratum - homogenous within group, heterogenous between group
		- Cluster - heterogenous within group, homogenous between group
	- If using this strategy, justify that the clusters are indeed the general population
4. Multistage Sampling
	- Divide the population into clusters, then randomly sample from each cluster.


### Data Modelling
In order to make use of data, some steps must be performed. Process is motivated by an overarching research question or goal.
The goal is how do we extract information from data.

Start with Raw Real-World Data -> Computer Representation of Data -> Mathematical Model -> Inference or Transformation or Insights

Data modelling should be backed-up with a research question
Research question may come in different forms:
- Sometimes out of curiosity
- But for projects its a well defined research question

A good RS question is:
1. Clear and concise - easy to explain, free of technical jargon
2. Feasible - could be answered using available data
3. Meaningful - addresses a real problem, not something trivial; or obvious
	- not needing a real problem for CSMODEL but as long as its not obvious 

Key steps:
Data processing
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Modelling

Real world data is often 'dirty'
	Incomplete - some values might be missing

In CSMODEL, the process is:
1. Identifying a real-world dataset
2. Formulating some questions or goals for the data
3. Performing pre-processing
4. Performing exploratory data analysis
5. Approximating data using a mathematical model
6. Drawing conclusions / answering the research questions
