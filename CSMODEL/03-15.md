- Data refers to pieces of facts and statistics collected and recorded
	- can be structured or unstructured
	- can be organized or unorganized
	- raw objective facts
	A collection of related pieces of data is referred to a dataset

- Information is **data** presented with context

**The question**: Does it make sense to perform arithmetic on it (data)?

If no:
	Categorical Data - descriptive data that may take several distinct categories (Qualitative data)
	1. Ordinal - have sense of ordering (ex: ranks)
	2. Nominal - no sense of ordering (ex: types)

If yes:
	Numerical Data - numerical information that can be objectively measured (Quantitative Data)
	1. Discrete - specific value (integers)
	2. Continuous - any value within a range (floating numbers)

Forms of data:
	1. Structured data - adheres to some structured model
	2. Unstructured data - difficult to fit in a structured model because it does not adhere to standardized format
	3. Graph-based data - best represented as pairwise relationship between objects
	4. Natural language - kind of unstructured data that contains information expressed in human language
	5. Audio and Video data - data that are not in the text format
	6. Generated data - automatically recorded by a computer application without human intervention

Data Collection
	Public sources (i.e., kaggle) (train sa leetcode)
		made public over the internet and kaggle.com is an example
	Private sources
		contacting people or organizations to request for data
		academic research groups
		corpos 
	Self-collected Data (will not do this)

Methods:
	Observational study
		no treatment has been explicitly applied
		no external bias applied to influence data
		questionnaires, surveys, census
	Experiment
		data collected from studies where researchers assign treatments to cases


In observational study, only correlation, or relationship between variables can be concluded
	Meaning we can only say variables are related and NOT one causes another or vice-versa.
For causation, a proper experimental setup must be conducted
	At least two comparison groups (one experimental, one control)
	Variation in the independent variable occurs before assessment of change in dependent variable
	Random assignment (either control or experimental group) to the comparison groups

Sometimes, data may be collected not for any specific research question or purpose, simply for future potential analysis

Data could already exist somewhere in the world waiting to be collected for some research goal or purpose
