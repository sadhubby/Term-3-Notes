ABC Nightline - IDEO Shopping Cart

1. Team Composition Hierarchy?
2. As granular as possible (split them apart and come up with as many phases as possible), What are the phases of their work?
	S: prompt
	?? 
	?? - find out the steps in the middle
	??
	End: Final product

project leader - good with groups and not because of seniority
eclectic - mix of people 
no titles here, no permanent assignments
no top down hierarchy, boss cant be the most insightful


process:
split into groups
find real experts 
learn as much from experts instead of learning from your own
demonstration and communication what they learned
designation of people to make sure the store head is represented
create ideas
build on ideas of others
criticize 
	enlightened trial and error
informal session
mock-ups presentation
fail often to succeed sooner
take best elements out of each prototype
comments from experts 


### The Design Process and the 29 Toys to Innovation

1. UX Squiggle
	- research is messy and uncertainty
	- concept is nearly refined
	- then design has clarity and focus

2. Double Diamond of UX

- left triangle:
	- finding out the right problem to solve
	- diverging - asking questions and collecting data
	- converging - build themes and clusters, form HMW questions (how might we...)
- right triangle
	- diverging - ideating, generate ideas as much as possible then evaluate
	- at the peak, implement then converge
	- converging - voting on ideas that are feasible, think creatively

Design Thinking

Empathise with users
define compelling problem
ideate create idea + solutions
build prototypes
verify with your users
deploy product

Universal Traveler

Acceptance 
	given prompt
Analysis
	collect data, understand users and tasks
Definition
	focus on the problem
Ideation
	brainstorming
idea selection
	pick top n
implementation
	scale up from low fidelity -> high fidelity
	low-fi (quick, cheap, dirty) - paper models, sketches
	high-fidelity (slowest, most expensive) - full interface
evaluation
	early tests - wizard of oz approach

#1 Make a mindmap
#2 Question your most basic assumptions
	reverse the common perception of a situation
	"kailangan ba ng gulong nung shopping cart"
#3 discover the real problem
	is there a more signifant problem I could be addressing.
	if theres a problem, ask "WHY" five times
#4 challenge the rules
	challenge the conventions and thwart the conventions
#5 See the positives
	what kind of people see the positives
#6 see the negatives
#7 dont take it too seriously
#8 Add 
#9 substract
#10 chop it up
	problem into smaller subproblems
#11 re-arrange
	move subject into a new situation
#12 substitute
	change certain things
#13 combine
	connect, arrange, link, unify and so on
#14 change the scale
#18 see the bigger picture
	go beyond set of problems you are facing to a more general area or domain
#21 see it from somebody else's shoes
#22 solve the opposite problem

on tuesday, discussing on interfaces and needfinding
friday, present short proposal
	tell broad design problem, establish some sources, why its important
	broad outline
