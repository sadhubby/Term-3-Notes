Before memes, we had Memex

Routes after graduating in CS
	Industry route
	Academia route
	Startup route

1945 - Vannevar Bush publish a paper called the Memex.
	notes to remember. very primitive version of notepad

ENIAC was the first electronic general purpose computer. It is Turing-complete. It is as big as a room. Operated by engineers

Then came personal computers bringing them from labs to homes
CLI became a standard (Command Line Interface)

What is an interface? 
	a way to make interaction between two incompatible systems
	you interface with another human being using language
	meaning to say, for a human to understand computers, there are interfaces, like CLI 

Touch screen was designed first but mouse was innovated more first.

### Some few terms:
1. Computer science 
	study of computers and algorithmic processes including principles
2. Human Computer Interaction
	field of computer science that focuses on the research and design of novel ways people can interact with computers and computing systems.

Ultimate design challenge: How do we balance a human's goals and needs and solutions

Goals of doing HCI work:
- Design novel interfaces
- Evaluate existing interfaces in terms of usability
- study how people use
- create modern technology ?? 

Usability - easy to learn, easy to use; also fun, collective efficacy, aesthetic tension

Affordance - can this design do this action. 

There should be a way for the user to do this action without telling them what to do

Going forward, analyze every single thing that you use, objects, microwaves, remotes, medicine bottles, apps, websites, os ng laptop. whenever you use them, ask:
1. is it easy to use? if you dont notice the interface, it probably is easy to use. if you notice it
   it can be because you like it or you hate it (do you enjoy it or do you hate it?)
2.
