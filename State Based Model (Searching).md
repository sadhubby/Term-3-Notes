searching algorithm for the most optimal

Graph Theory - inspirited by seven bridges of Konigsberg
2 large island which were connected to each other and the mainland by 7 bridges

Rooted Graph
Graph: A set of nodes and a set of arcs that connects the nodes
Node: a state in the graph
Arc: connect each pair or nodes in sequence
Rooted Graph: A graph with a parent node from which all path in the graph originated
Tip/Leaf: A node that has no children
Ancestor: A node which has all nodes positioned after it
Descendent: A node which has all nodes positioned before it 

State Space Model
State space provides a number of possible solutions to a given problem. It is used to graphically represent the problem domain.
Applies widely in games and expert systems.

Expert Systems are domain specific. So if the expert system is about car problems, the domain is simply about car problems like finding out what the problem is then so on

State Space Graph
- The problem domain where the knowledge is represented  is called problem space
- Solution for the problem can be searched in the space
- Knowledge is represented graphically
	- ex: the 8-puzzle

for every start state, we may have different set of ways to fulfill the rules
