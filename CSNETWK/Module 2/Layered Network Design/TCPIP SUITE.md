Application Layer
Transport Layer
Internet Layer
Network Interface

4 Layers vs OSI's 7

1. Application
	- Similar to OSI application layer
	- communication, end users interact with email or messaging. 
	- combination of application, presentation and session layer of OSI
2. Transport
	- Defined by two protocols:
		- Transmission Control Protocol - TCP
		- User Datagram Protocol - UDP
	UDP is about fast
	TCP is about precision and accuracy
	
3.  Internet 
	- internetworking 
	- primary protocol is IP 
	- transfers user messages from source host to destination host
	- uses internet or IP addresses
4. Network Interface
	- connects a host to local network hardware
	- makes connection to physical medium

### Encapsulation and Decapsulation

Encapsulation 
- packaging data into suitable form to be transmitted over the network
- Data has protocol information added to it as passed down
- Generic name is PDU Protocol data unit
- protocol information consists of headers (address information), trailers (for error control) and other items
Decapsulation
- reverses
